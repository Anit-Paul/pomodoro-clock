# Pomodoro Timer with Tkinter

## Overview

This is a simple **Pomodoro Timer** application built using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method where you work for 25 minutes (the "work" session), followed by a 5-minute break. After four work sessions, you get a longer 20-minute break. The application helps you manage your work and break intervals while offering an interactive GUI to track the time and progress.

## Features

- Work for 30 minutes, followed by a 5-minute short break, and a 20-minute long break after 4 work sessions.
- Visual representation of the countdown in a friendly user interface.
- Option to start and reset the timer.
- Color coding for different stages: 
  - Green for "Work"
  - Pink for "Short Break"
  - Red for "Long Break"
  
## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (Python's built-in GUI library)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Tkinter is bundled with Python, so no additional installation is necessary.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `pomodoro_timer.py` file.
2. Place an image named `image.png` in the same directory for the background.
3. Run the `pomodoro_timer.py` script:
   ```bash
   python pomodoro_timer.py
   ```

### Functions:
- **Start**: Starts the Pomodoro timer, beginning with a work session and switching to break sessions.
- **Reset**: Resets the timer to its initial state (00:00), clears the tick marks, and restores the default color and label.
